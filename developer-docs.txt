Crave Developer Documentation Website — Full Explanation
The Crave Developer Documentation Website will serve as the central knowledge hub for everything related to the Crave Browser — its architecture, design philosophy, roadmap, APIs, extension framework, performance modules, and internal C++ systems. The platform will be built using Next.js, optimized for clarity, scalability, and long-term maintainability. All functional content will be added later; the initial version will use strictly controlled placeholder text.

1. Purpose of the Documentation Website
The Crave browser is a complete C++ project aiming to provide a more robust, more transparent, and more privacy-aligned alternative to modern browsers like Brave. To enable contributors, researchers, and internal engineers to understand the system at a granular level, Crave requires a dedicated documentation portal that:
Explains the browser’s internal architecture in a modular way
Outlines C++ coding patterns used in Crave
Highlights security, privacy, and performance models
Exposes public APIs for extensions and custom modules
Centralizes build instructions, debugging processes, and release cycles
The site must be visually polished, extremely easy to navigate, and future-proof.

2. Design Philosophy & Theme
The entire platform will follow a strict dark theme using only the four approved colors:
Background / Core Surfaces: #000000
Primary Light Text / Neutral Accents: #EFECE3
Secondary Accents / Borders: #8FABD4
CTA Buttons / Highlight Elements: #4A70A9
This palette must be used consistently across all pages, components, and code blocks.
No additional shades or variations will be introduced to preserve brand identity and visual discipline.

3. Website Structure
A. Landing Page
The landing page introduces the Crave Browser project with high-level placeholder sections:
Project overview
Mission / vision statements
Quick-access links to documentation, APIs, blog, and roadmap
Feature showcase cards using accent borders
CTA buttons styled using #4A70A9
This page acts as the front door to the Crave developer environment.

B. Documentation Root Page
This acts as the central index for all technical content. It includes placeholder entries for:
Browser architecture overview
Rendering pipeline
Networking layer
Security & privacy model
Multi-process structure
Storage mechanism overview
Performance engine
Extension framework
Development workflow
A left navigation sidebar will provide structured access to every documentation category.

C. Browser Internals Section
(for now use dummy texts and sections like lorem ipsum) make multiple sections 

D. API Reference
(for now use dummy texts and sections like lorem ipsum) make multiple sections to replicate an original site for documentation

E. Build & Compile Guide
(for now use dummy texts and sections like lorem ipsum)

F. Tutorials & Guides
(for now use dummy texts and sections like lorem ipsum)

G. Blog System
The blog section will be powered by Next.js and include:
Release notes
Feature announcements
Technical deep dives
RFCs and experimental proposals
Community updates
Each post page will follow the same dark layout.

H. Footer
The footer contains placeholder navigation for:
Repository links
Documentation versions
Contribution channels
Licensing information

4. UI Components & Styling
Navigation Bar
Clean, minimal, with #EFECE3 text
Active item highlighted with #4A70A9
Sidebar
Collapsible
Borders in #8FABD4
Section headers in #EFECE3
Buttons
Primary CTA: #4A70A9
Secondary CTA: #8FABD4
Hover states remain inside palette
Code Blocks
Background: #000000
Text: #EFECE3
Border: #4A70A9
Cards & Callouts
Border color: #8FABD4
Title text: #EFECE3
This keeps the interface sophisticated, uniform, and easily readable.

5. Placeholder Content Framework
Every documentation page will use templated placeholders such as:
[TITLE PLACEHOLDER]
[SECTION DESCRIPTION PLACEHOLDER]
[CODE EXAMPLE PLACEHOLDER]
[TO BE ADDED LATER]
This makes future content insertion seamless and precise.

The Crave Developer Docs Website is intended to become a best-in-class documentation ecosystem — simple, intuitive, visually cohesive, and engineered for long-term relevance. As Crave evolves into a mature, full-scale browser built entirely in C++, this documentation website will be the backbone supporting its developer community and future contributions.
